This is a module template that can be adopted according to the needs of the programme.
It can be updated remotely or by branching the template.

The common phases of this are as follows:
1. Module Team branch a specific year module: ex. ML-2025 -> ML-2026-MT-Draft
2. Module Team collaborate on their branch, further develops the contents and enhances the module's flaws.
3. Module Team declares their branch ready for review by the Programme Leader(PL): ML-2026-MT-Draft -> ML-2026-MT-Draft-Under-Review-PL
4. Programme Leader may ask for some amendments, and then  ML-2026-MT-Draft-Under-Review-PL go back to ML-2026-MT-Draft
5. Module Team is confident they have made the required changes, PL approve changes and module have the tag ML-2026-MT-Draft-Approved-PL
6. Module Team forwards a push request for the module to DES ML-2026-MT-Draft-Approved-PL -> ML-2026-MT-Draft-Under-Review-DES
7. DES review and ask for some changes if any, then once they are satisfied with the results, module has the tag ML-2026-MT-Approved-DES
8. DES then merge the new branch which becomes ML-2026
